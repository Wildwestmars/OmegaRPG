Untitled Omegalike RPG
=====

A text-based roguelike game heavily based on storytelling and player interactions.
Based on the [C++ Omega RPG engine](https://github.com/cwc/omegaRPG)

Building
-----

Tools for building the game are located in the `build` directory.

### OS X/Linux/Cygwin

The Makefile is located in `build/unix`. Running `make` in that directory will
build everything.

### Windows

Visual Studio solution/project files are located in `build/win32`. Since these
files are typically incompatible with older versions of VS, each Visual Studio
version has its own subfolder. Either:

Choose the subfolder appropriate to your version and open the `OmegaRPG.sln`
file therein, or run the `build_debug.bat` file to automatically build the
game.

About the Game
-----

This is very WIP, and I'll likely require some time before I start working on it.

About this Project
-----

This is very WIP, and I'm only forking and editing the description now since I'm not on a computer that can effectively code.

Future goals include stripping down the game to its core parts, leaving only the skeletal structure of the game (Engine, GUI, ETC).
